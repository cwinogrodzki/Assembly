# Assembly
Each program consists of a .cpp file containing a driver class and a .s file containing the function/algorithm implemented in assembly.
t1sb.s corresponds with t1sdm.cpp, etc.
These were created to run on a Linux raspberry pi machine at school, not sure how to actually run these anywhere else lol
